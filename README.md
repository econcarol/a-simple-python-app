# a-simple-python-app
This is a simple Python app where one can upload data, triggering a script to read the uploaded data and process it, and download the result in the end. Specifically, a user uploads an Excel file named ab. After uploading, the app computes the sum of a and b, and prints the result on the web page. It also gives the user an option to download this result as an Excel file named c. I use Flask as the framework and Heroku as the deployment platform.
